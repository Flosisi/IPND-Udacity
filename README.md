# Udacity - Intro to Programming Nano Degree (IPND)

As a career changer that come from a non-computer science background, I took this 190 hours* nanodegree as my first step towards coding. 
In this program, I've learned the following modules and created projects related to those topics.


## Stage 0: Introduction
Key learnings: 
- High level overview of the World Wide Web (browsers, HTTP requests, Servers, the Internet)
- HTML basics (tags, Syntax, Whitespace, Inline vs Block elements, HTML document structure) 
- Team collaboration in Slack
<br>

## Stage 1: Make a Web Page
Key learnings:
- Creating a structured HTML document (page structure, visual styling, designing with boxes)
- Adding CSS for style (divs-spans-classes, semantic tags, DevTools)
- Debugging HTML and CSS code

> a fully functional webpage with top menu, inline and block elements, hover, contact form and original images and design.
<br>
  
## Stage 2: Code Your Own Quiz
Key learnings:
- Getting setup with Python and Command Line Interface (CLI) basics
- String manipulation (slicing, concatenation, find, replace, split, join)
- Control flow, loops and structured data (if statements, while loops, list and for loops)
- Debugging strategies

<br>Showcase project: <a href="udacity-ipnd/P3 - Guess The Words - Game.py">Guess The Word!</a>
> a fill-in-the blank style quiz with 3 difficulty levels. The users can choose their own number of tries.
<br>

## Stage 3: Create a Movie Website
Key learnings: 
- Import modules into Python
- Create a program using Python modules: time and webbrowser
- Understanding Classes and Objects in Python
- Advance Class Making (class variables, inheritance, reusing methods, method overloading)

<br>Showcase project: <a href="https://github.com/Flosisi/udacity-ipnd/tree/master/P4%20-%20Entertainment%20Center%20Website">Entertainment Centre Website</a>
> a static web page generated from a set of python codes that allows visitors to browse the movies and watch the trailer directly on the webpage by launching a video player.
<br>

## Stage 4: Discover Your Path
Key learnings: A quick overview of various paths in programming, what are the distinctions between them, and how the roles interact with each others. The paths that were explored are Front-End Programming, Back-End Programming, Mobile Programming, and Data Analysis Programming.
<br>

## Stage 5: Chosen path - Data Analytics Programming
Key learnings:
- Using Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook
- Python data type: Dictionaries
- Data Analysis processes (problem statement, data acquisition, data wrangling, data exploration, conclusion phase, communicate analysis and findings) 
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for 1D and 2D data

<br>Showcase project: <a href="udacity-ipnd/P6 - IPND-DA-Project-Final.ipynb">How Lifestyle Related to Life Expectancies</a>
> Posed 5 pairing questions from 5 data sets from GapMinder. Analyses are done using NumPy and Pandas 1D and 2D, and then visualised with Matplotlib and Seaborn. Processes and findings are documented methodologically in Jupyter Notebook. One most surprising finding: "Apparently, alcohol might not be that bad at all!"
